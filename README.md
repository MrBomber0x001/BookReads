# BookReads

:star: BookReads is a complete solution for book worms from a social network for readers and authors to a marketplace platform for stores bundled into single place
just for readers and to readers.

:one: The main idea was to make a centralized place which can connect readers which each other, connecting them with stores to simplify the buying and selling process instead of the regular old way of contacting each store to find specific book, or to actually head over to a store which can be relative distant from the user.

:two: The second idea was to make a centralized place for readers to be able to sell their **used** old books to another users without the need to meet them on place, just with a simple click the user can assign a delivery man to deliver his shipment to the buyer without any effort.
